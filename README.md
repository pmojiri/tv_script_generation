# tv_script_generation
Generate a TV script by defining and training a RNN network using PyTorch

## Introduction
In this project, I have generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I have used Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our my public GitHub repo, in the tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there. If you want to clone the repository to your computer using:

```
git clone https://github.com/pmojiri/tv_script_generation.git
```
This way you can stay up to date with any changes I make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.
